# SideScrollR

Side Scrolling Game to demonstrate some basic Unity work in Version 2019.3.0f6.

The goal is a basic side scrolling game done in my free time to ultimately show my Unity ability.

Always A WIP, check back for newer versions!

## Fox Model was adapted in Blender by me from Toon Cat Lite asset on Unity's Asset store.
 ### Idle A, Idle B, Walk, Run animations were adapted from Default Animations, while I created Sleep.


# Thank you and enjoy!!!!!!!
